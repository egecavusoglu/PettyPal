Ege Cavusoglu Lab 2 (463866)

Creative Portion:

1. I have added fun fact feature about the pets that will display with animation and spoken to the user.

2. I have used a button to trigger the action and looked up fun facts about the pets online. Then called a helper function to animate the fun fact on the screen with animation. The animation varied based on the orientation of the phone and ran smoothly. Also works on all screen sizes. After the fun fact is rendered on the screen I have used the AVFoundation module to turn text into speech using the builtin class and methods.

3. This makes the app more interactive and gives more character to the pets while teaching the users fun facts.
